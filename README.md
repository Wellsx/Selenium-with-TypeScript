# [SauceLabs](https://www.saucedemo.com/) Frontend Automation Framework

---

This repository contains a frontend automation framework built using Selenium with TypeScript, Chai assertion library, Mocha test framework, Page Object Model (POM) design, and Mochawesome test reporter. The framework is designed to facilitate automated testing of web applications.

## Features

- Utilizes Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web elements and performing actions on web pages.
- Implements TypeScript for writing test scripts, providing enhanced type safety and productivity.
- Integrates [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion library to create readable and expressive assertions for test validations.
- Adopts [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework for organizing and executing test cases with features like test hooks and reporting.
- Implements the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better maintainability and reusability of test code.
- Includes Mochawesome test reporter for generating detailed HTML reports with test execution results.
